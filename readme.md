Poker - Five card Draw written in html5 with a PHP Rest backend and jQuery UI frontend

This project is a work to provide myself and my wife and avenue to a portfolio on the web.

I (Rodney K. Olivier) have been writing code for both Web and standalone projects since the year 1991 while my wife (Jeanette A Gogan-Olivier) has been a graphic artist working in watercolor and other mediums since the year 1978.

Together we both enjoy writing web-sites and I enjoy writing web applications as well.

=====

Recently I was searching for work and was provided a challenge to write a REST service for an obscure process and it occurred to me that I could write a card game using HTML5, JavaScript and a REST service.  Since I am versed in PHP it was the best choice (in respect to my current skill set) in which to write a REST service.

I will write more information about the REST service in a different article but for now let it suffice to say that the Service (being my first of this type) is still in Alpha development so some errors in logic or implementation are to be expected.
